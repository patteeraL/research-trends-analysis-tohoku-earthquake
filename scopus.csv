Advances in computational and data retrieval speeds, coupled with novel deep learning applications to disaster science, have shifted research focus away from statistical estimators. TFFs offer a “disaster signature” with comparative value, though these models are seldom applied to generate damage estimates. With applicability in mind, we challenge this notion and investigate a portion of TFF literature, selecting three TFFs and two application methodologies to generate a building damage estimation baseline. Further, we propose a simple machine learning method, trained on physical parameters inspired by, but expanded beyond, TFF intensity measures. We test these three methods on the 2011 Ishinomaki dataset after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in both binary and multi-class cases. We explore: (1) the quality of building damage estimation using TFF application methods; (2) whether TFF can generalize to out-of-domain building damage datasets; (3) a novel machine learning approach to perform the same task. Our findings suggest that: both TFF methods and our model have the potential to achieve good binary results; TFF methods struggle with multiple classes and out-of-domain tasks, while our proposed method appears to generalize better. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",,"article; earthquake; Japan; machine learning; physical parameters"

The proposed methodology combines the power of random forest (RF) with data that are simulated at seismic and tsunami monitoring locations. The RF model is well-suited for predicting highly nonlinear multi-hazard loss because of its nonparametric regression and ensemble learning capabilities. The study targets the cities of Iwanuma and Onagawa in Tohoku, Japan, where seismic and tsunami monitoring networks have been deployed. To encompass a diverse range of future multi-hazard loss estimation, an RF model is constructed based on 4000 simulated earthquake events with peak ground velocity and tsunami wave amplitude captured at ground-motion monitoring sites and offshore wave monitoring sensors, respectively. The incorporation of 10 ground-motion monitoring sites and five offshore wave monitoring sensors significantly enhances the model’s forecasting power, leading to a notable 60% decrease in mean squared error and 20% increase in the (Formula presented.) value compared to scenarios where no monitoring sensors are utilized. By harnessing the capabilities of RF and leveraging detailed sensing data, RF achieves (Formula presented.) values over 90%, which can contribute to enhanced disaster risk management. © 2023 The Author(s).

To address this issue, a subgrid-scale (SGS) model of tsunami inundation, called the individual drag force model (iDFM), is developed. In this model, the sum of the building drag forces in a computational mesh is fed back to the flow field by taking into account spatial information about multiple structures in the mesh. To evaluate the model performance, idealized numerical experiments using simple urban topography with several types of spatial layout patterns and hindcast physical experiments focusing upon Onagawa Town affected by the 2011 Tohoku, Japan tsunami as a historical event are conducted. Results are compared with HR tsunami simulations using building-resolved topographical data, called the structure resolving model (SRM). In general, the iDFM (and other SGS models) characterizes the effects of structures as resistance elements that reduce the fluid velocity in momentum conservation. On the other hand, the SRM evaluates these effects as topography and feeds them back into not only momentum conservation but also mass conservation and wet/dry boundary conditions. Therefore, the iDFM can model the overall inundation characteristics, such as the limits of inundation, more than 102 times efficiently compared with the SRM, although it cannot capture local phenomena driven by structures, such as surface rising due to blocking and contracting current between structures. In both numerical and historical tsunami (Onagawa) cases, there were small differences between the modeled inundation characteristics, such as the maximum surface elevation and fluid velocity, and the time series of inundation leading edges determined by the iDFM due to the computational grid cell sizes. The observed differences between the idealized numerical experiment and the historical tsunami case can be affected by the drag coefficient and the Froude number during the tsunami run-up. © 2022","Building; Individual drag force model (iDFM); Structure resolving model (SRM); Subgrid-scale (SGS); Tsunami inundation","Buildings; Drag; Floods; Mesh generation; Topography; Drag force model; Fluid velocities; High resolution; Individual drag force model; Numerical experiments; Structure resolving model; Sub-Grid-Scale models; Subgrid scale; Subgrid-scale; Tsunami inundation; Tsunamis"

Three major tsunamis: The Indian Ocean in 2004, the 2011 Tohoku tsunami, and the 2018 Palu tsunami were significant landmarks in the history of tsunami science. All the three tsunamis, as mentioned, suffered from either no warning or poor reception of the alerts issued. Various lessons learned, consequent numerical models proposed, post-2004 tsunami damage findings manifested into solutions. However, the misperceived solutions led to a disastrous impact of the 2011 Tohoku event. In the following years, numerous improvements in warning systems and community preparedness frameworks were proposed and implemented. The contributions and new findings have added multi-fold advancements to tsunami science progress. Later, the 2018 Palu tsunami happened and again led to a massive loss of life and property. The warning systems and community seemed un-prepared for this non-seismic tsunami. A significant change is to take place in tsunami science practices and solutions. The 2018 tsunami is one of the most discussed and researched events concerning the palaeotsunami records, damage assessment, and source findings. In the new era, using machine learning and deep learning prevails in all the fields related to tsunami science.

Additionally, the majority of these studies have used the maximum value as the measure of each of these two factors. However, building damage may not occur when the maximum flow depth and the maximum flow velocity of the tsunami are reached. This study addressed two objectives based on the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. Firstly, to find out whether the maximum values of the flow depth and flow velocity are the same as their critical values and, secondly, to verify which combination of the parameters is the best predictor of the building damage level. The data from 18,000 buildings in Ishinomaki City, Japan, with the cooperation of the Japanese joint survey team, were analyzed using the decision tree related algorithms. The critical variables were the simulated data at the time when the buildings collapsed. The analysis showed the accuracy of the prediction based on the group of variables. Finally, the findings showed that the combination of the critical flow depth and maximum flow velocity provided the highest accuracy for classifying the level of building damage. © 2013 IEEE.","2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami; Building damages; data mining; decision tree algorithm","Decision trees; Flow velocity; Predictive analytics; Trees (mathematics); Tsunamis; Velocity; Building damage; Critical variables; Decision tree classification; Great east japan earthquakes; Maximum flow velocities; Prediction-based; Related algorithms; Tsunami disaster; Buildings"

To mitigate these problems, the present study develops a novel end-to-end benchmark model, termed the pyramid pooling module semi-Siamese network (PPM-SSNet), based on a large-scale xBD satellite imagery dataset. The high precision of the proposed model is achieved by adding residual blocks with dilated convolution and squeeze-and-excitation blocks into the network. Simultaneously, the highly automated process of satellite imagery input and damage classification result output is reached by employing concurrent learned attention mechanisms through a semi-Siamese network for end-to-end input and output purposes.

The occurrence of such devastating seismic events is uncertain and depends on their recurrence characteristics (e.g., inter-arrival time distribution and parameters) as well as elapsed time since the last major event. Current standard probabilistic loss models for earthquakes and tsunamis are based on a time-independent Poisson process and uniform earthquake slip distribution. Thereby, considerations of more realistic time-dependent earthquake occurrence and heterogeneous earthquake slip distribution are necessary. This study presents an innovative computational framework for conducting a time-dependent multi-hazard loss estimation of a building portfolio subjected to megathrust subduction earthquakes and tsunamis. The earthquake occurrence is represented by a set of multiple renewal models, which are implemented using a logic-tree approach, whereas earthquake rupture characterization is based on stochastic source models with variable fault geometry and heterogeneous slip distribution. By integrating these hazard components with seismic and tsunami fragility functions, multi-hazard loss potential for a coastal community can be evaluated quantitatively by considering different possibilities of earthquake recurrence and rupture characteristics. To demonstrate the implementation of the developed time-dependent multi-hazard loss model, the Tohoku region of Japan is considered. © Copyright © 2020 Goda.","building portfolio; megathrust subduction earthquake; multi-hazard loss estimation; strong shaking; time-dependent earthquake occurrence; tsunami","Computation theory; Fault slips; Hazards; Poisson distribution; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Tsunamis; Uncertainty analysis; Coastal communities; Computational framework; Earthquake occurrences; Earthquake recurrence; Earthquake rupture; Earthquake slip distribution; Fragility function; Subduction earthquakes; Earthquakes; earthquake recurrence; estimation method; ground motion; seismic hazard; subduction; time dependent behavior; tsunami"

Fragility functions developed from past tsunami events (e.g., the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami) are often applied directly, without modification, to other areas at risk of tsunami for the purpose of damage and loss estimations. Consequentially, estimates carry uncertainty due to disparities in construction standards and coastal morphology between the specific region for which the fragility functions were originally derived and the region where they are being used. The main objective of this study is to provide an alternative approach to assessing tsunami damage, especially for buildings in regions where previously developed fragility functions do not exist. A damage assessment model is proposed in this study, where load-resistance analysis is performed for each building by evaluating hydrodynamic forces, buoyancies and debris impacts and comparing them to the resistance forces of each building. Numerical simulation was performed in this study to reproduce the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami in Ishinomaki, which is chosen as a study site. Flow depths and velocities were calculated for approximately 20&thinsp;000 wooden buildings in Ishinomaki. Similarly, resistance forces (lateral and vertical) are estimated for each of these buildings. The buildings are then evaluated for their potential of collapsing. Results from this study reflect a higher accuracy in predicting building collapse when using the proposed load-resistance analysis, as compared to previously developed fragility functions in the same study area. Damage is also observed to have likely occurred before flow depth and velocity reach maximum values. With the above considerations, the proposed damage model might well be an alternative for building damage assessments in areas that have yet to be affected by modern tsunami events. © Author(s) 2019.",,"building; collapse; hydrodynamic force; loading; model; structural analysis; tsunami; Honshu; Ishinomaki; Japan; Miyagi; Tohoku"

Developing an optimal model for detecting damage in multitemporal SAR intensity images has been a focus of research. Recent studies have shown that computing changes over a moving window that clusters neighboring pixels is effective in identifying damaged buildings. Unfortunately, classifying tsunami-induced building damage into detailed damage classes remains a challenge. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel multiclass classification model that considers a high-dimensional feature space derived from several sizes of pixel windows and to provide guidance on how to define a multiclass classification scheme for detecting tsunami-induced damage. The proposed model uses a support vector machine (SVM) to determine the parameters of the discriminant function. The generalization ability of the model was tested on the field survey of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami and on a pair of TerraSAR-X images. The results show that the combination of different sizes of pixel windows has better performance for multiclass classification using SAR images. In addition, we discuss the limitations and potential use of multiclass building damage classification based on performance and various classification schemes. Notably, our findings suggest that the detectable classes for tsunami damage appear to differ from the detectable classes for earthquake damage. For earthquake damage, it is well known that a lower damage grade can rarely be distinguished in SAR images. However, such a damage grade is apparently easy to identify from tsunami-induced damage grades in SAR images. Taking this characteristic into consideration, we have successfully defined a detectable three-class classification scheme. © 2018 by the authors.","Buildings; Change detection; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunami","Buildings; Classification (of information); Damage detection; Disasters; Earthquakes; Image classification; Pixels; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Tsunamis; Change detection; Discriminant functions; Generalization ability; Great east japan earthquakes; High-dimensional feature space; Multi-class classification; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Three-class classification; Radar imaging"

Therefore, a highly efficient and intelligent remote-sensing image-processing framework is urgently required to mitigate these challenges. In this article, a deep learning algorithm for the semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing images using the U-net convolutional network was proposed to map the damage rapidly. The algorithm was implemented within a Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit framework in the GeoAI platform provided by Microsoft. The study takes the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake-Tsunami as a case study, for which the pre- and post-disaster high-resolution WorldView-2 image is used. The performance of the proposed U-net model is compared with that of deep residual U-net. The comparison highlights the superiority U-net for tsunami damage mapping in this work. Our proposed method achieves the overall accuracy of 70.9% in classifying the damage into ""washed away,"" ""collapsed,"" and ""survived"" at the pixel level. In future disaster scenarios, our proposed model can generate the damage map in approximately 2-15 min when the preprocessed remote-sensing datasets are available. Our proposed damage-mapping framework has significantly improved the application value in operational disaster response practice by substantially reducing the manual operation steps required in the actual disaster response. Besides, the proposed framework is highly flexible to extend to other scenarios and various disaster types, which can accelerate operational disaster response practice. © 2018 by the authors.","2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami; Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit; Operational damage-mapping; Semantic segmentation; U-net convolutional neural network","Convolution; Damage detection; Deep learning; Earthquakes; Image segmentation; Mapping; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Semantics; Tsunamis; 2011 tohoku earthquakes; Convolutional neural network; Damage mapping; MicroSoft; Semantic segmentation; Emergency services"

The success of supervised machine learning strongly depends on the availability of training samples. Unfortunately, in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster, training samples become available only after several weeks or even months. However, following a disaster, information on the damage situation is one of the most important necessities for rapid search-and-rescue efforts and relief distribution. In this paper, a modification of the supervised machine learning classification technique called logistic regression is presented. Here, the training samples are replaced with probabilistic information, which is calculated from the spatial distribution of the hazard under consideration and one or more fragility functions. Such damage probabilities can be collected almost in real time for specific disasters such as earthquakes and/or tsunamis. We present the application of the proposed method to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami for collapsed building detection. The results show good agreement with a field survey performed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an overall accuracy of over 80%.

However, inundation depth cannot be taken as the sole representation of tsunami impact on structures, especially when structural damage is caused by hydrodynamic and debris impact forces that are mainly determined by flow velocity. To reflect the influence of flow velocity in addition to inundation depth in tsunami risk assessment, a tsunami loss estimation method that adopts both inundation depth and flow velocity (i.e., bivariate intensity measures) in evaluating tsunami damage is developed. To consider a wide range of possible tsunami inundation scenarios, Monte Carlo-based tsunami simulations are performed using stochastic earthquake slip distributions derived from a spectral synthesis method and probabilistic scaling relationships of earthquake source parameters. By focusing on Sendai (plain coast) and Onagawa (ria coast) in the Miyagi Prefecture of Japan in a case study, the stochastic tsunami loss is evaluated by total economic loss and its spatial distribution at different scales. The results indicate that tsunami loss prediction is highly sensitive to modelling resolution and inclusion of flow velocity for buildings located less than 1 km from the sea for Sendai and Onagawa of Miyagi Prefecture. © 2017 by the authors.

The purpose is to provide guidance on how to train a powerful learning machine for change detection in SAR images and to contribute to a better understanding of potentials and limitations of supervised change detection approaches. This becomes particularly important on the background of a rapidly growing demand for SAR change detection to support rapid situation awareness in case of natural disasters. The application environment of this study thus focuses on detecting changes caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami disaster, where single polarized TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR intensity images are used as input. An unprecedented reference dataset of more than 18,000 buildings that have been visually inspected by local authorities for damages after the disaster forms a solid statistical population for the performance experiments. Several critical choices commonly made during the training stage of a learning machine are being assessed for their influence on the change detection performance, including sampling approach, location and number of training samples, classification scheme, change feature space and the acquisition dates of the satellite images. Furthermore, the proposed machine learning approach is compared with the widely used change image thresholding. The study concludes that a well-trained and tuned SVM can provide highly accurate change detections that outperform change image thresholding. While good performance is achieved in the binary change detection case, a distinction between multiple change classes in terms of damage grades leads to poor performance in the tested experimental setting. The major drawback of a machine learning approach is related to the high costs of training. The outcomes of this study, however, indicate that given dynamic parameter tuning, feature selection and an appropriate sampling approach, already small training samples (100 samples per class) are sufficient to produce high change detection rates. Moreover, the experiments show a good generalization ability of SVM which allows transfer and reuse of trained learning machines. © 2016 by the authors.","Change detection; Earthquake; Machine learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunami","Artificial intelligence; Damage detection; Disasters; Earthquakes; Feature extraction; Geophysics; Learning systems; Population statistics; Radar; Radar signal processing; Sampling; Space-based radar; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunamis; 2011 tohoku earthquakes; Application environment; Change detection; Earthquake and tsunamis; L-band synthetic aperture radars; Machine learning approaches; Performance experiment; Supervised change detection; Radar imaging"

The source parameters include the fault width, fault length, fault area, mean slip, maximum slip, Box-Cox power, correlation lengths along dip and strike directions, and Hurst number. The scaling relationships are developed by distinguishing tsunamigenic models from non-tsunamigenic models; typically, the former occurs in ocean and has gentler dip angles than the latter. The new models are based on extensive data, including recent mega-thrust events, and thus are more reliable. Moreover, they can be implemented as multivariate probabilistic models that take into account uncertainty and dependency of the multiple source parameters. The comparison between new and existing models indicates that the new relationships are similar to the existing ones for earthquakes with magnitudes up to about 8.0, whereas the relationships for the fault width and related parameters differ significantly for larger mega-thrust events. An application of the developed scaling relationships in tsunami hazard analysis is demonstrated by synthesizing stochastic earthquake source models in the Tohoku region of Japan. The examples are aimed at providing practical guidance as to how the developed scaling relationships can be implemented in stochastic tsunami simulation. The numerical results indicate that the effects of magnitude scaling of the source parameters and their uncertainties have major influence on the tsunami hazard assessment. © 2016 The Author(s).","earthquake source parameter; finite-fault rupture model; Scaling relationship; stochastic source modeling; tsunami simulation; tsunamigenic earthquake","Earthquakes; Faulting; Hazards; Stochastic systems; Tsunamis; Earthquake source parameters; Fault ruptures; Scaling relationships; Source modeling; Tsunami simulation; Tsunamigenic; Stochastic models"

Automated detection of features such as building roof for template matching and pattern recognition is great significance in the image processing field. In this chapter, a method which is developed optimizing the shape and size of hit-or-miss morphological filtering parameters with morphological operators is presented for building roof target detection. Morphological operations of opening and closing with constructions are applied to segmented images. Hit-or-Miss Transform (HMT) has been successfully applied for template matching in binary images. The proposed approach involves several advanced morphological operators among which an adaptive HMT with varying size and shape of the structuring elements. VHR space borne images consisting of a pre and post 2011 Pacific coast of Tohoku earthquake and the tsunami site of the Ishinomaki, Miyagi area in Japan were used. Experimental results show that the identified probability of building can reach more than 81 % by this method. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Airborne VHR images; Building extraction; HMT; Mathematical morphological profile; Natural hazard","Buildings; Extraction; Hazards; Image processing; Mathematical morphology; Pattern recognition; Roofs; Structural optimization; Template matching; Building extraction; HMT; Morphological profile; Natural hazard; VHR images; Image matching"

Buildings affected by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami were the focus in developing this method. In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, buildings exhibit high backscattering caused by double-bounce reflection and layover. However, if the buildings are completely washed away or structurally destroyed by the tsunami, then this high backscattering might be reduced, and the post-event SAR data will show a lower sigma nought value than the pre-event SAR data. To exploit these relationships, a rapid method for classifying tsunami-induced building damage into multiple classes was developed by analyzing the statistical relationship between the change ratios in areas with high backscattering and in areas with building damage. The method was developed for the affected city of Sendai, Japan, based on the decision tree application of a machine learning algorithm. The results provided an overall accuracy of 67.4% and a kappa statistic of 0.47. To validate its transferability, the method was applied to the town of Watari, and an overall accuracy of 58.7% and a kappa statistic of 0.38 were obtained. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Building damage; change detection; TerraSAR-X; tsunami","Artificial intelligence; Backscattering; Damage detection; Data mining; Decision trees; Earthquakes; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Radar; Radar reflection; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Trees (mathematics); Tsunamis; 2011 tohoku earthquakes; Building damage; Change detection; High resolution radar; Kappa statistic; Overall accuracies; Statistical relationship; TerraSAR-X; Buildings"

The method is based on the assumption that independent of the dramatic changes of the ground surface, still many unchanged areas, which we call unchanged-feature points, can be found. First, we use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to detect the unchanged-feature point candidates in pre- and post-event TerraSAR-X images at similar locations. Then, a sub-pixel alignment procedure is used to obtain accurately matched point pairs. Finally, the unchanged-feature points are detected by eliminating unstable point pairs. The method was tested on TerraSAR-X images covering the Sendai area in Tohoku, Japan. Compared with the global position system (GPS) records and two previously published methods, our method is found to be an effective tool to detect crustal movement at a sub-pixel level. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,"Earthquakes; Feature extraction; Pixels; Satellites; 2011 tohoku earthquakes; Effective tool; Global position systems; Ground surfaces; Intensity images; Matched point pairs; Scale invariant feature transform algorithms (SIFT); Sub pixels; Motion estimation; algorithm; crustal movement; GPS; pixel; satellite imagery; TerraSAR-X; Tohoku earthquake 2011; Honshu; Japan; Miyagi; Sendai; Tohoku"

The objective of this paper is to identify the significant predictor variables and the direction of their potential relationship to the damage level in order to create a predicting formula for damage level. This study used the detailed data of damaged buildings in Ishinomaki city, Miyagi prefecture, Japan, collected by MLIT. The explanatory variables tested included the inundation depth, number of floors, structural material, and function of the building. Ordinal regression was applied to model the relationship between the ordinal outcome variable (damage level) and the predictors. The findings indicated that inundation depth, structural material, and function of building were significantly associated with the damage level. In addition to this new type of model, this research provides a valuable insight into the relative influence of different factors on building damage and suggestions that may help to revise the classification of current standards. This study can contribute to academic tsunami research by assessing the contribution of different variables to the observed damage using new approaches based on statistical analysis and regression. Moreover, practical applications of these results include understanding of the predominant factors driving tsunami damage to structures, implementation of the relevant variables into the proposed, or alternative model in order to improve current damage predictions by taking into account not only inundation depth, but also variables such as structural material and function of building. © 2014 The Author(s).","2011 Great East Japan tsunami; Building damage level; Ordinal regression; Prediction","building; earthquake damage; regression analysis; structural response; tsunami event; Honshu; Ishinomaki; Japan; Miyagi; Tohoku"

Recent earthquakes in Japan, including the Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake of March 2011, have substantially increased the observations of strong-motion records that can be used to compare alternative site-response models at large strains and can subsequently provide insight into the accuracy and precision of site-response models. Using the Kiban-Kyoshin network (KiK-net) downhole array data in Japan, we analyze the accuracy (bias) and variability (precision) resulting from common siteresponse modeling assumptions, and we identify critical parameters that significantly contribute to the uncertainty in site-response analyses. We perform linear and equivalent-linear site-response analyses at 100 KiK-net sites using 3720 ground motions ranging in amplitude from weak to strong; 204 of these records have peak ground accelerations greater than 0:3g at the ground surface. We find that the maximum shear strain in the soil profile, the observed peak ground acceleration at the ground surface, and the predominant spectral period of the surface ground motion are the best predictors of where the evaluated models become inaccurate and/or imprecise. The peak shear strains beyond which linear analyses become inaccurate in predicting surface pseudospectral accelerations (PSA; presumably as a result of nonlinear soil behavior) are a function of vibration period and are between 0.01% and 0.1% for periods &lt; 0:5 s. Equivalent-linear analyses become inaccurate at peak strains of ~0:4% over this range of periods. We find that, for the sites and ground motions considered, site-response residuals at spectral periods &gt; 0:5 s do not display noticeable effects of nonlinear soil behavior.",,"Accuracy and precision; Bias and variability; Critical parameter; Nonlinear soil behavior; Peak ground acceleration; Strong ground motion; Surface ground motion; Tohoku earthquakes; Earthquake effects; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; accuracy assessment; earthquake magnitude; ground motion; peak acceleration; seismic response; shear strain; strong motion; Tohoku earthquake 2011; vibration; Japan"
